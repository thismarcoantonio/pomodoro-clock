Pomodoro Clock
======
Hi, I've developed this Pomodoro Clock using vanilla Javascript. If you wan't to see it live, just check it [here](https://thismarcoantonio.com/pomodoro-clock/ "My Personal Website").


What I've done
-----
To develop this project, I've used gulp as my task runner, also a little bit of css pre-processor with stylus.
